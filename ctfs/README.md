# Capture The Flag (CTF) Writeups

This section contains my personal collection of CTF writeups, organized by platform. CTFs are cybersecurity competitions that help develop and test penetration testing skills in a controlled environment.

## What are CTFs?

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity challenges where participants solve security puzzles by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or files to obtain a "flag" - usually a specific string of text that proves successful completion.

## Platforms Covered

### [ðŸŸ© Hack The Box](hack-the-box/)
Industry-leading cybersecurity training platform with various machines and challenges ranging from beginner to expert difficulty.

### [ðŸ”´ TryHackMe](tryhackme/)
Security training platform with guided "rooms" designed to teach specific cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

## Benefits of CTFs

- Practical application of offensive security techniques
- Learning to think like an attacker
- Exposure to various technologies and vulnerability types
- Development of problem-solving skills
- Documentation practice through writeups

## How to Use These Writeups

These writeups serve as:
- Personal reference for techniques and approaches
- Knowledge sharing with the security community
- Documentation of my learning journey

**Note:** If you're attempting these challenges yourself, I recommend trying to solve them independently before consulting these writeups.

## Methodology

In general, my approach to CTFs follows this methodology:
1. **Reconnaissance** - Information gathering
2. **Enumeration** - Finding potential entry points
3. **Exploitation** - Leveraging vulnerabilities
4. **Privilege Escalation** - Gaining higher permissions
5. **Post-Exploitation** - Finding flags and documenting findings

Happy hacking!
